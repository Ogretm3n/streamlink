## About This Fork

This fork adds ClearKey support to Streamlink for DRM protected streams.

**Tested with:**

- CENC MPD streams
- SAMPLE-AES-CTR HLS streams

## Credits

Thanks to ImAleeexx - he was the first one to add the code to work with keys: [ImAleeexx/streamlink-drm](https://github.com/ImAleeexx/streamlink-drm)

# üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip3 install --user -U git+https://github.com/Ogretm3n/streamlink-clearkey.git
```

## Usage

```bash
streamlink MPD/HLS_URL [quality] --key HEX
```

**For multiple keys:**

```bash
streamlink MPD/HLS_URL [quality] --key HEX --key HEX
```

**Note:** Only add the key (not the kid).

# üéØ Features

Streamlink is built on top of a plugin system which allows support for new services to be added easily.  
Most of the popular streaming services are supported, such as [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), and many more.

A list of all plugins currently included can be found on the [plugins page][streamlink-plugins].

# üí° Quickstart

After installing, simply run:

```sh
streamlink "STREAMURL" best
```

For DRM protected streams:

```sh
streamlink "STREAMURL" best --key "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

The default behavior of Streamlink is to play back streams in the [VLC player][player-vlc], but a lot of other options and output methods are available, such as writing the stream to the filesystem, reading stream metadata, etc.

For more in-depth usage, please refer to the [CLI documentation][streamlink-documentation-cli].

An [API guide][streamlink-documentation-apiguide] and [API reference][streamlink-documentation-apiref] is available for Python implementors of Streamlink.
